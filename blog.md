# Having a blast as a Bubbler âš¡

Towards the end of February, I suddenly realized that the summer had gone and that the finish of my internship program was coming. Looking back, this summer was hot, as usual, but what is different is that I chill myself out by working in a cool place with a group of cool people aiming at bringing creativity into the world. The place is called Redbubble. 

## At first sight
Before I joined, I caught a glimpse of the workplace. It has funky graffiti and stylish painting on the walls, colourful decoration and comfortable couches at every corner. The place was full of character. I couldnâ€™t help imagining what the people would be like there.

On December 5th I found out the answer! I was welcomed by the team and many new people I came across. I also met three other interns who started a bit earlier than me. Through the induction, I got to know the many interesting activities going on there apart from work, such as Video Lunch, Coding Dojo, daily meditation and Book Club, where each individual can focus on their growth. 

## Into data science
I started as a Data Science Intern in the Discovery team. This team is focused on empowering users to discover their things at Redbubble. In the beginning week, I got familiar with BigQuery, the analytics data warehouse on Google Cloud. Through small tasks of analysing the website visits and search keywords, I am getting increasingly excited about the real big industry data and curious about what underlying patterns are.

From the second week of my internship, I was able to hit the ground running on a real project, building a knowledge graph of semantic relationships between tags. In the Redbubble database, there are millions of artworks, each one is denoted with a number of tags by the artist. Therefore, understanding the relationships between tags is fundamental to our knowledge about artworks.

So the intern found a mission! ðŸ˜Ž

I started the project with research to understand the mainstream approaches and challenges in building a knowledge graph of semantic tag relationships. When I delved deeper into the research, and especially with my proof of concept on the demo of tag similarity, the team got more excited about how we could do to improve user experience by utilizing knowledge in tags. 

## Pairing
The next step was to make the system scalable on Google Cloud Platform. To do this, I paired with two of my teammates: Jakob and Adam. During the exploration, we accumulated valuable experience with DataFlow and cracked different challenges that come along. 

I found pairing very rewarding. It not only inspires good ideas from both partners, but gave me valuable feedback by showing me how others organise and tackle problems. 

## Connecting with people through art
At Redbubble, we are not only thrilled by cracking problems and solving puzzles, we are really passionate about art and the way it helps people to connect. 

At Redbubble, it is common for us to admire our fellowsâ€™ newly acquired art treasures.

As a newcomer, I attended a session called Meeting the Chief, where everyone including our CEO Martin shared their choice of purchased artworks and reason why they love it. It is amazing to hear the stories behind the artworks. It could be a clock that is used to decorate the new house, it could be a space-cat tee that expresses enthusiasm towards the unknown space, or a lovely tote bag for a family member for Christmas. In that moment, I felt connected to these people by sharing their joy, curiosity and happiness. 
## Growing our talents
Iâ€™ve met many amazing engineers at Redbubble. When taking a close look, I realized it is those talented people who have the strongest curiosity and eager to learn. 

At Redbubble, individuals are not confined to a single area. The engineers can choose the direction based on their interest to develop their expertise, from undertaking different challenges, pairing with engineers with different background, technical development training, or self-learning. Video lunch, coding dojos and study groups are the perfect opportunities to uncover hidden gems in different areas. 
 
I joined the Video Lunch course on Machine Learning on a weekly basis. Although I had undertaken the subject at University, I still learned many new things by thinking and reviewing together with the group. Meanwhile, I was also impressed by their passion about the fascinating Machine Learning topics. 

## After 5pm

Now you may picture Bubblers as creative, passionate, hard core. But I forgot to mention one thing: they are definitely approachable! 

At Redbubble you will never lack for fun people to hang out with. Actually, â€˜have funâ€™ was the agreed working principle of our team when we brainstormed about how we could do better. And I am pretty sure it is same with other teams.

Here I also met many fun people, with whom I play foosball and badminton, watch Australian Open, have Friday night drinks, play Texas Poker, do stretching and meditation and other fun activities. There is definitely more to check out, or you can start a group to have fun in a different way.

## Looking forward
In the end, I would like to thank Redbubble for providing such an amazing opportunity, my teammates Sam and Anuj for giving valuable feedback, the whole team for being so welcoming and supportive, the culture for being so tolerant and inspiring.

The summer is ending, but the memories of this fruitful period will not easily fade away, with the inspiration, laughter and excitement that I will take along all the way.
